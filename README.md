# TypeScript to-do list
This is a homework for the laserants TypeScript course.
I created a to-do list using TypeScript. Most of the UI is created by TypeScript, not HTML, just to practice a little bit more.

The user can create projects, which themselves can have tasks. The user can change the name of the projects and tasks by clicking on the edit button. The tasks can be marked as done by clicking on the card checkbox.
